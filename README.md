# Bidirectional-List
Bidirectional List implementation in C++ language without the use of STL-containers.

I have implemented it with the use of smart pointers and object-oriented techniques such as encapsulation and abstraction.
This bidirectional list has functions to: 
- Find an element inside the list,
- Push back, push to the front and insert an element into the list,
- Deserialise and serialise the data,
- Read and write into txt files,
- Sort the entire list using the Merge sort algorithm (both ascendingly and descendingly),
- Store integers, floating types, characters and strings,
- Custom structs and classes require their own functions to work, but exemplary structures have been tested and are in the main.cpp file.

This doubly-linked list was a project for my computer programming laboratories.
It has really helped me grow my programming and design skills and I have learned so much while working on this project.
